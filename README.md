# Intel Fab Lean Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a simulated Intel-inspired semiconductor fabrication process, applying Lean Manufacturing principles to identify and address inefficiencies. It was developed as part of the final project for MSE 507: Lean Manufacturing Systems at California State University, Northridge.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to evaluate the efficiency, waste, and flow constraints in a semiconductor production environment by applying Lean Thinking tools. This includes value stream mapping, cycle and queue time analysis, and data-driven visualization of waste and performance metrics.

## Key Areas of Analysis

- Lean Waste Identification: Queue time, downtime, defects, and overprocessing  
- Flow Metrics: Cycle time, queue time, and machine status  
- Yield and Quality: Defect counts and wafer yield percentage  
- Pull System Simulation: Based on machine uptime and queue behavior  
- Continuous Improvement: Using PDCA cycle and statistical process control (SPC)  
- Strategic Recommendations: Based on Lean frameworks and course methodologies  

## Project Structure

- `Intel_Fab_Dataset.csv` – Simulated dataset of 10,000 records  
- `analysis.py` – Python script for generating all visualizations and metrics  
- `FINAL_REPORT.md` – Full project report with detailed methodology and insights  
- PNG Image Files – Charts for cycle time, queue time, defects, correlation, and more
